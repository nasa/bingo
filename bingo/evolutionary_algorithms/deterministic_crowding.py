"""The "Deterministic Crowding" evolutionary algorithm

This module defines the basis of the "deterministic crowding" evolutionary
algorithm in bingo analyses. The next generation is selected by pairing parents
with their offspring and advancing the most fit of the two.

    A class for the deterministic crowding evolutionary algorithm in bingo.

    Parameters
    ----------
    evaluation : evaluation
        The evaluation algorithm that sets the fitness on the population.
    crossover : Crossover
        The algorithm that performs crossover during variation.
    mutation : Mutation
        The algorithm that performs mutation during variation.
    crossover_probability : float
        Probability that crossover will occur on an individual.
    mutation_probability : float
        Probability that mutation will occur on an individual.

    Attributes
    ----------
    evaluation : evaluation
        evaluation instance to perform evaluation on a population
    selection : DeterministicCrowding
        Performs selection on a population via deterministic crowding
    variation : VarAnd
        Performs VarAnd variation on a population
