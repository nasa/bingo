Implicit Regression, Adapted from Schmidt and Lipson papers

Fitness in this method is the difference of partial derivatives pairs
calculated with the data and the input `Equation` individual.

This may not be a correct implementation of this algorithm.  Importantly,
it couldn't reproduce the  results in the papers. Currently, there is no effort
to maintain functionality of this module.
