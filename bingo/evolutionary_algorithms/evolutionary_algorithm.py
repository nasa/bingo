"""The base of evolutionary algorithm definition

This module defines the basis of evolutionary algorithms in bingo analyses.
An evolutionary algorithms in bingo is defined by three phases: variation,
evaluation, and selection.  These phases, when repeated, define the evolution
of a population.

    """The algorithm used to perform generational steps.

    The basic implementation used in this base Base implementation is a simple
    steady-state Base (akin to simpleEA in DEAP)

    Parameters
    ----------
    variation : `variation`
        The phase of bingo EAs that is responsible for varying the population
        (usually through some form of crossover and/or mutation).
    evaluation : `evaluation`
        The phase in bingo EAs responsible for the evaluation of the fitness of
        the individuals in the population.
    selection : `selection`
        The phase of bingo EAs responsible for selecting the individuals in a
        population which survive into the next generation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    variation : `variation`
        Public access to the variation phase of the EA
    evaluation : `evaluation`
        Public access to the evaluation phase of the EA
    selection : `selection`
        Public access to the selection phase of the EA
