## General
Bingo is an open source package for performing symbolic regression.  Its 
emphasis lies on the efficient use of HPC resources.  For the most part, things 
should work "out of the box", with a few dependencies that are standard in many 
python installs.


## Dependencies
Bingo is intended for use with Python 3.x
Required packages:
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- mpi4py
- pytest (if the testing suite is to be run)


## BingoCpp
A section of bingo is written in c++ for increased performance.  In order to 
take advantage of this capability, the code must be compiled.  See the 
documentation in the bingocpp subdirectory for more information.

Note that bingo can be run without the bingocpp portion, it will just have lower 
performance.


## Tests
Several end-to-end tests are included with bingo to ensure a proper 
installation.  The tests can be performed by running "py.test" from the test 
directory


## Getting Started
Currently, the best place to get started in bingo is by going through some 
examples.  The examples directory contains several python scripts and jupyter 
notebook examples of varying complexity.  The simplegp examples illustrate the 
very basics of symbolic regression in bingo, utilizing a simplified interface.  
More complex (and more efficient) examples can be found as well.
