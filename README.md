## Description
Bingo is an open source package for performing symbolic regression, though it 
can be used as a general purpose evolutionary optimization package.  

## Key Features
*   Integrated local optimization strategies
*   Parallel island evolution strategy implemented with mpi4py
*   Coevolution of fitness predictors

# Quick Start

## Documentation
[Full Documentation Here](https://nasa.github.io/bingo/)

## Installation

```sh
pip install bingo-nasa
```

## Usage Example
A no-fuss way of using Bingo is by using the scikit-learn wrapper:
`SymbolicRegressor`. Let's setup a test case to show how it works.

### Setting Up the Regressor

There are many options that can be set in `SymbolicRegressor`. Here we set some basic ones including
`population_size` (the number of equations in a population), `stack_size` (the max number of nodes per equation), and `use_simplification`
(whether to use simplification to speed up equation evaluation and for easier reading). You can see all of `SymbolicRegressor`'s
options [here](https://nasa.github.io/bingo/_apidocs/bingo.symbolic_regression.html#module-bingo.symbolic_regression.symbolic_regressor).


```python
from bingo.symbolic_regression.symbolic_regressor import SymbolicRegressor
regressor = SymbolicRegressor(population_size=100, stack_size=16,
                              use_simplification=True)
```

    /home/gbomarit/Projects/Genetic_Programming/bingo/bingo/symbolic_regression/__init__.py:31: UserWarning: Could not load C++ modules No module named 'bingocpp.build.bingocpp'
      warnings.warn(f"Could not load C++ modules {import_err}")


### Training Data
Here we're just creating some dummy training data from the equation $5.0 X_0^2 + 3.5 X_0$. More on training data can be found
in the [data formatting guide](https://nasa.github.io/bingo/_high_level/data_formatting.html).
```python
import numpy as np
X_0 = np.linspace(-10, 10, num=30).reshape((-1, 1))
X = np.array(X_0)
y = 5.0 * X_0 ** 2 + 3.5 * X_0
```


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(X, y)
plt.xlabel("X_0")
plt.ylabel("y")
plt.title("Training Data")
plt.show()
```

### Fitting the Regressor

Fitting is as simple as calling the `.fit()` method.


```python
regressor.fit(X, y)
```

    using 1 processes
     Generating a diverse population took 274 iterations.
    archipelago: <class 'bingo.evolutionary_optimizers.island.Island'>
    done with opt, best_ind: X_0 + (5.0)((0.49999999999999967)(X_0) + (X_0)(X_0)), fitness: 5.4391466376923e-28
    reran CLO, best_ind: X_0 + (5.0)((0.4999999999999999)(X_0) + (X_0)(X_0)), fitness: 5.352980018399097e-28


### Getting the Best Individual


```python
best_individual = regressor.get_best_individual()
print("best individual is:", best_individual)
```

    best individual is: X_0 + (5.0)((0.4999999999999999)(X_0) + (X_0)(X_0))


### Predicting Data with the Best Individual

You can use the regressor's `.predict(X)` or
the best_individual's `.evaluate_equation_at(X)` to get
its predictions for `X`.


```python
pred_y = regressor.predict(X)
pred_y = best_individual.evaluate_equation_at(X)

plt.scatter(X, y)
plt.plot(X, pred_y, 'r')
plt.xlabel("X_0")
plt.ylabel("y")
plt.legend(["Actual", "Predicted"])
plt.show()
```

# Source

## Installation from Source

For those looking to develop their own features in Bingo.

First clone the repo and move into the directory:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nasa/bingo.git
cd bingo
```

Then make sure you have the requirements necessary to use Bingo:


```sh
conda env create -f conda_environment.yml
```

or

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Optional) Then build the c++ performance library BingoCpp:

```sh
./.build_bingocpp.sh
```

Now you should be good to go! You can run Bingo's test suite to make sure that
the installation process worked properly:

```sh
pytest tests
```

Add Bingo to your Python path to begin using it from other directories.

```sh
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/bingo/"
```

and test it with:

```sh
python -c 'import bingo; import bingocpp'
```
