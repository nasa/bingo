    A class for the "mu plus lambda" evolutionary algorithm in bingo.

    Parameters
    ----------
    evaluation : evaluation
        The evaluation algorithm that sets the fitness on the population.
    selection : selection
        selection instance to perform selection on a population
    crossover : Crossover
        The algorithm that performs crossover during variation.
    mutation : Mutation
        The algorithm that performs mutation during variation.
    crossover_probability : float
        Probability that crossover will occur on an individual.
    mutation_probability : float
        Probability that mutation will occur on an individual.
    number_offspring : int
        The number of offspring produced from variation.
    target_population_size : int (optional)
        The targeted population size. Default is to keep the population the
        same size as the starting population

    ----------
    variation : VarOr
        VarOr variation to perform variation on a population
